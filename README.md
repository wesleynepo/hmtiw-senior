# HMTIW - Senior (How many time I worked?)

A utility open-source app for checking how many "TIME" you already worked today or any day in the current month. This project was born as a solution for a daily problem that I and many coworkers had, doing the math to know how many hours we worked, and like anything that repeat more than once, I got bothered and started it. It's intended to consume a third-party API and get the clocking events, there is no intention of making it possible to register any event.
